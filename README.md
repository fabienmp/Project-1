## Foreword

Many of us looking for the right area to settle. It is often challenging to decide on the proper place to invest and buy a property. Many websites offer data regarding the demographics of a certain zip code.

Very few currently have the ability to compare multiple zip codes and when they do, it's often in the form of an indigestible blob of tabular data.

## Getting Started

The purpose of this project is to create a quick report comparing two different zip codes in the US.
To begin the process, it is neccessary to select the two zip codes that need to be compared. Upon selection, the area associated to the zip code selected will be located on a map. The GOOGLE Maps API is used for this purpose. The report is composed of multiple pieces of demographic data from the ATTOM Community API. The data is then rendered in the form of charts using the GOOGLE Charts API. 

## Share Feature

Once a report is created, it is possible to create a shareable link (Links are persistent and saved on our Firebase Instance). Currently, the 'copy to clip board' button does not work properly. It is neccessary to manually copy the link before sharing it.

## Future Improvements

1. One to many categories of data could be selected. This would make the rendering of the report a bit more customized. After all, no everyone is interested in the same data.

2. The sharing feature currently makes the user copy the link. It would be cool to have a way to email that link directly to someone else using MailChimp for instance.

3. One to many zip codes could be selected. Currently only two can be compared.

4. The ATTOM API can also return property located in the area. This would be a great add to the report so that people can see what inventory is available.
